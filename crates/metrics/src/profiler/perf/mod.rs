//! Hardware performance counters for `#[timed]`. The hot path is deliberately
//! dumb: read the opened counters into a fixed [`PerfSample`] that rides
//! alongside each mark; all labelling and derived ratios happen in
//! postprocessing.
//!
//! Layers (read top-down):
//! - [`events`] — name → perf_event_open `(type, config)` for this CPU; the
//!   single place to add a metric. Pure logic, no I/O on the hot path.
//! - [`sample`] — [`PerfSample`], the raw value record.
//! - [`source`] — per-thread rdpmc [`read`], feature-gated.
//! - `raw` — the rdpmc primitive (only compiled with the `perf` feature).
//!
//! Collection is gated behind the `perf` feature; without it `#[timed]` reads
//! no counters, and even with it [`read`] returns `None` when
//! `perf_event_paranoid` blocks the events — so `#[timed]` degrades to timing
//! only.
